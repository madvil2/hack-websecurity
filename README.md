# Next-Gen Anti-Fraud System

## Introduction
In our latest hackathon project, we developed a pioneering anti-fraud system designed to protect banks and their clients from fraud, theft of personal data, and unauthorized access to funds. Our solution integrates seamlessly into any application, offering comprehensive security enhancements that shield against a wide array of cyber threats.

## Features

### Social Engineering Protection
- **Face ID Recognition**: Enhances privacy by blurring the screen if an unauthorized person approaches from behind, detected via webcam.
- **Manual Data Block**: Allows users to manually block access to their personal data.
- **Developer Console Alerts**: Issues warnings to users when the developer console is opened, preventing malicious use.

### Advanced Security Measures
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attack Prevention**: Secures application data by signing each request with HMAC.SHA256, utilizing JWT session tokens for enhanced security.
- **Hardware Keylogger Defense**: Combines voice recognition and a virtual keyboard to thwart keyloggers.
- **Bot Attack Mitigation**: Employs techniques such as user fingerprint verification, honeypots, and two-factor authentication to defend against bots.

### Web Security
- **Firewall**: A robust firewall that guards against common attacks such as CSRF, XSS, using comprehensive white/blacklisting methods.
- **Iframe Loading Prohibition & Clickjacking Protection**: Ensures that the application frame cannot be used maliciously and protects users from clickjacking attacks.

## Technology Stack
- JavaScript
- Web Security Techniques (HMAC.SHA256, JWT)
- Face ID Recognition Technologies
- Voice Recognition Systems

## Installation
To integrate our anti-fraud system into your application, simply include the following script tag:

```html
<script src="bundle.js"></script>
```

## Usage
Once integrated, the system operates automatically, providing real-time protection and alerts. Users can activate additional security measures through their application settings.

## Conclusion
Our anti-fraud system is designed to provide an impenetrable layer of security for financial applications, safeguarding against the evolving landscape of cyber threats. By incorporating cutting-edge technologies and proactive defense mechanisms, we offer a solution that not only protects but adapts to the needs of modern security.
